# Macintosh-Classic-Reloaded connection traces

plans from Kai Robinsons Recreation of the Macintosh Classic logic board
https://github.com/kr239/Macintosh-Classic-Reloaded

because there is no boardview file of the 820-0390-03 board i created a photoshop file with all the lanes in the region of the battery in singe layers (front & back) for measuring continuity and to identify broken connections

use photoshop or a compatible program to activate the layers/pins you want to trace, dont forget to also select the front or back layer of the trace (o .. front, u .. back)
